# pdfsg

This is a simple graphics C library that outputs PDF.
Its main features are:

- uses little memory because it outputs graphics contents immediately.
- supports groups that can be reused without duplication.
- supports page labels.
- outputs PDF 1.4 because it supports fill and stroke transparency.

pdfsg is based on [PDFGen](https://github.com/AndreRenaud/PDFGen ), public domain code by [Andre Renaud](https://github.com/AndreRenaud). See NOTES.md for details on how that code was used and adapted.
