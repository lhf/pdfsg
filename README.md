# pdfsg

This is a simple graphics C library that outputs PDF.
Its main features are:

- outputs graphics contents immediately, thus requiring little memory.
- supports groups that can be reused without duplication.
- supports fill and stroke transparency.
- supports page labels.

pdfsg is based on [PDFGen](https://github.com/AndreRenaud/PDFGen ), public domain code by [Andre Renaud](https://github.com/AndreRenaud). See NOTES.md for details on how that code was used and adapted.
